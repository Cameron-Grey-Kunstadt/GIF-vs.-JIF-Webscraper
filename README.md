# GIF-vs.-JIF-Webscraper

Its the argument of a generation, how do you pronounce GIF. There are many good arguments for why it is pronounced either "gif" or "jif". I happen to say gif, it is how I first read the word in my head and am now eternally biased toward it, but, to prove why I originally read it that way, and I believe most people did the same, I wrote a webscraper to see which of the two pronounciations of the letter g, at the beginning of a word, is more common in the english language. This code goes through websters dictionary's g section, collects each link for every word, and opens each link, determines if it has a phonetic guide, and if it does, that is used to determine how that initial g is pronounced: g or j, and counts all words with each prononciation. What I found was that in the english language its an almost 5:1 ratio of g to j sounds. Meaning an English speaker may be 5 times more likely to read it as GIF. Fascinating! Maybe sorting through 9000 words was worth this small contribution to the debate. Thanks for viewing!
