# GIF-vs.-JIF-Webscraper

Its the argument of a generation, how do you pronounce GIF. There are many good arguments for why it is pronounced either "gif" or "jif". I happen to say gif, it is how I first read the word in my head and am now eternally biased toward it. Every english speaker when confronted with a word they do not know, relies on educated assumptions about that word to guess a pronunciation. In order to prove why I think I originally read it that way, and why I believe most people did the same, I wrote a webscraper to see which of the two pronounciations of the letter g, at the beginning of a word, is more common in the english language. 

This code goes through websters dictionary's "G" section, collects each link for every word, and opens each link, determines if it has a phonetic guide, and if it does, uses the phonetic guide to determine how that initial g is pronounced: with a soft or hard g, a "g" or a "j" sound, and counts all words with each prononciation. 

In going through over 9000 "G" words in the english language I discovered it is an almost 5:1 ratio of "g" to "j" sounds. Meaning an English speaker, all else being equal may be 5 times more likely to read it as GIF with a "g". Fascinating! 

Maybe sorting through 9000 words was worth this small contribution to a completely pointless debate. 

Thanks for viewing!
